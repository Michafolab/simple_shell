**NAME**

**command interpreter (shell)**

**SYNOPSIS**
./ssh

**DESCRIPTION**

simple_shell replicates a command line interpreter (a shell), which is a user interface program for access to an operating system's services. This shell is designed to interact with a linux distribution or unix like system that uses linux system calls and other commands found in the linux PATH, for example, the $PATH:



**/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:**
simple_shell has a set of custom built-in commands, and also integrates with other commands located in the system's PATH. The output is designed to exactly or to closely replicate the shell 'sh' or 'dash'as possible.




**$ man dash**

  simple_shell \
  
takes commands from files, shell scripts or user input in either an interactive or non-interactive mode (explained in INVOCATION section).

**********************************************************************************************


INVOCATION**

To initialize simple_shell, you must compile all the included files using the GNU compiler collection: gcc. Then run the output file, with a command such as this:



**
**$ ./a.out.**  **

simple_shell has been written to pass all of these warning checks and was designed to be compiled with the following command:



******************************************************************************************************************
 $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh****
 
 
If simple_shell is executed, it will initialize in what is considered 'interactive mode.' In this scenario, the user is prompted for a command and then the command is executed after the newline or 'enter' is input. simple_shell can also function in non-interactive mode by using shell scripts, such as a '|' before the simple_shell executable file ('ssh'). This is an example:




**** $ echo 'ls' | ./hsh****

Commands may also be input into simple_shell through a file containing commands:


**** $ cat aFile | ./hsh********


**OPTIONS**
simple_shell does not take any options
